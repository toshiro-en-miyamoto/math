## A Fundamental Counting Principle

**Fundamental Counting Principle**:
Consider an activity consisting of $k$ independent subtasks. Assume that

- $task_1$ can be performed in $m_1$ ways
- $task_2$ can be performed in $m_2$ ways
- &vellip;
- $task_k$ can be performed in $m_m$ ways

Then this activity can be completed in $m_1 \times m_2 \times \cdots \times m_k$ different number of ways.

**Example 4.2**:
Find the number of all possible six-digit numbers that can be formed by using 2, 6, 8 and 9.

- the unit place can be filled by any of the four given digits
- the tenth place can be filled by any of the four given digits
- &hellip; and so on &hellip;
- up to the hundred-thousandth place

Hence, the required answer is $4^6$.
