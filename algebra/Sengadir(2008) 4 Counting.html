        <strong>Fundamental Counting Principle</strong>:
        Consider an activity consisting of <var>k</var> independent subtasks. Assume that
        <ul>
          <li>task₁ can be performed in m₁ ways,</li>
          <li>task₂ can be performed in m₂ ways,</li>
          <li>&vellip;</li>
          <li>task<sub>k</sub> can be performed in m<sub>k</sub> ways.</li>

        <strong>Example 4.2</strong>:
        Find the number of all possible six-digit numbers that can be formed by using 2, 6, 8 and 9.

        Solution:

          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The unit place can be filled by any of the four given digits,</li>

        <strong>Proposition 4.1</strong>:
        Let <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> be finite sets with |A| = n and |B| = m. Then the number of all functions <var>f</var> : A &rightarrow; B is m<sup>n</sup>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Proof:
        <section>
          <p>
            Let A = {x₁, x₂, &ctdot;, x<sub>n</sub>}. Then
            <ul>
              <li>f(x₁) can be defined in <var>m</var> possible ways</li>
              <li>f(x₂) can be defined in <var>m</var> possible ways</li>
              <li>&vellip;</li>
              <li>f(x<sub>n</sub>) can be defined in <var>m</var> possible ways</li>

        <strong>Definition (function)</strong>:
        A function, <var>f</var> : A &rightarrow; B, is a rule that associates each element <var>x</var> in <var>A</var> with an element in <var>B</var>, denoted f(x). It demands that
        <ul>
          <li>if x₁ = x₂ then f(x₁) = f(x₂)</li>
          <li>for all x &in; A there exists f(x) such that f(x) &in; B</li>
        </ul>
        Note that
        <ul>
          <li>even if f(x₁) = f(x₂), x₁ is not necessarily equal to x₂</li>
          <li>there exists y &in; B such that y &notin; { f(x) : x &in; A }</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="description">
      <p>
        <strong>Functional solution to example 4.7</strong>:
        Consider one specific distribution of the <var>n</var> objects into <var>m</var> distinct boxes.
        <ul>
          <li>Think of a relation from objects to boxes. Because each object is placed in one of boxes, a function <var>f</var> : <var>objects</var> &rightarrow; <var>boxes</var> can be defined.</li>
          <li>Think of a relation from boxes to objects. Some boxes can be empty, meaning that some boxes are not related to objects. Hence, the relation cannot be a function.</li>
        </ul>
        Thus, the number of all possible <var>f</var> : <var>objects</var> &rightarrow; <var>boxes</var> = m<sup>n</sup> is the required answer.

      <p>
        <strong>Functional solution to example 4.2</strong>:
        Consider a six-digit number that can be formed by using 2, 6, 8 and 9.
        <ul>
          <li>Think of a relation from digits to places. Some digits may not appear in some number (e.g., 226688), meaning that some digits are not related to places. Hence, the relation cannot be a function.</li>
          <li>Think of a relation from places to digits. Because each place is filled with one of digits, a function <var>f</var> : <var>places</var> &rightarrow; <var>digits</var> can be defined.</li>
        </ul>
        Thus, the number of all possible <var>f</var> : <var>places</var> &rightarrow; <var>digits</var> = 4<sup>6</sup> is the required answer.

    <h2>4.1.1. Arrangements</h2>
    <section class="description">
      <p>In how many ways can three objects be arranged in some order? Let us call these objects as <var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, <var>c</var>. We can arrange them as <var>abc</var>, <var>acb</var>, <var>bac</var>, <var>bca</var>, <var>cab</var>, <var>cba</var>. These are all the possible ways and hence three objects can be arranged in six different ways.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="definition">
      <p>
        <strong>Proposition 4.2</strong>:
        <var>r</var> objects can be arranged in <var>r!</var> ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        Proof:
        <section>
          <p>Imagine an array of <var>r</var> boxes. Consider the filling of each of the <var>r</var> boxes as a subtask.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We can place any of the <var>r</var> objects in the first box. Thus, the number of ways of completing this first task is <var>r</var>.</li>
            <li>Now we are left with <var>r</var> &minus; 1 objects. So the second box can be filled in <var>r</var> &minus; 1 ways.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Thus, by using the counting principle of the previous section, the number of different arrangements of <var>r</var> things is r &times; (r &minus; 1) &times; &ctdot; &times; 1 = r!.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Definition (permutation)</strong>:
        Let there be <var>n</var> objects. The number of ways of <i>choosing and arranging</i> <var>r</var> objects out of the <var>n</var> objects is called the permutation of <var>r</var> objects out of <var>n</var>, denoted <sup>n</sup>P<sub>r</sub>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Proposition 4.3</strong>:
        <section>
          <sup>n</sup>P<sub>r</sub>
          = n(n &minus; 1)(n &minus; 2)&ctdot;(n &minus; r + 1)
          = n! &divide; (n &minus; r)!
        </section>
        Proof:
        <section>
          <p>Consider an array of <var>r</var> boxes. We can place</p>
          <ul>
            <li>any of the <var>n</var> &minus; 0 objects in the first box</li>

          <p>
            Hence, the number of ways this can be achieved is

        <strong>Example 4.18</strong>:
        Consider five-letter words that can be formed using nine letters A, B, &ctdot;, I without repetition. How many of them contain A and I?

      <p>
        Solution:
        <section>
          <ul>
            <li>First, we shall allot two places out of five to A and I. This can be done in <sup>5</sup>P<sub>2</sub> ways.</li>

          <p>

        In Example 4.18, the order in which the letters appear is important. But in this example, letters are just selected without any consideration for the order. We need the idea of <i>combination</i>.
