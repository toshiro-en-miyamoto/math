## [Natural numbers](https://www.cuemath.com/numbers/natural-numbers/)

*Natural numbers* (include) all the positive integers from 1 to infinity. Natural numbers are also called counting numbers because they do not include zero or negative numbers.

## [Whole numbers](https://www.cuemath.com/numbers/whole-numbers/)

*Whole numbers* are a set of numbers including all natural numbers and zero. They are a part of real numbers that do not include fractions, decimals, or negative numbers.

## [Integers](https://www.cuemath.com/numbers/integers/)

An *integer* is a number with no decimal or fractional part, from the set of negative and positive numbers, including zero.

## [Decimals](https://www.cuemath.com/numbers/decimals/)

*Decimals* are used to express the whole number and fraction together. Here, we will separate the whole number from the fraction by inserting a "`.`", which is called a *decimal point*.

## [Real numbers](https://www.cuemath.com/numbers/real-numbers/)

*Real numbers* include rational numbers like positive and negative integers, fractions, and irrational numbers. Any number that we can think of, except *complex numbers*, is a real number.

## [Fractions](https://www.cuemath.com/numbers/fractions/)

In Mathematics, *fractions* are represented as a numerical value, which defines a part of a whole. A fraction can be a portion or section of any quantity out of a whole, where the whole can be any number, a specific value, or a thing.

Let us understand this concept using an example. (⋯ Take) a pizza that is divided into 8 equal parts. Now, if we want to express one selected part of the pizza, we can express it as `1/8` which shows that out of 8 equal parts, we are referring to 1 part.

It means one in eight equal parts. It can also be read as:

- One-eighth, or
- 1 by 8

## [Rational numbers](https://www.cuemath.com/numbers/rational-numbers/)

*Rational numbers* are in the form of `p/q`, where `p` and `q` can be any integer and `q ≠ 0`. Most often people find it confusing to differentiate between *fractions* and rational numbers because of the basic structure of numbers, that is `p/q` form.

- Fractions are made up of whole numbers as their numerator and denominator.
- Rational numbers are made up of integers as their numerator and denominator.

## [Irrational Numbers](https://www.cuemath.com/numbers/irrational-numbers/)

*Irrational numbers* are the set of real numbers that cannot be expressed in the form of a fraction, `p/q` where `p` and `q` are integers. The *denominator* `q` is not equal to zero (`q ≠ 0`). Also, the decimal expansion of an irrational number is neither terminating nor repeating.

## [Precision](https://www.cuemath.com/measurement/accurate-vs-precise/)

*Precision* is the maximum number of digits to the right of the decimal.

| Term      | Meaning
|-----------|---------
| Acuracy   | The closeness of the value to a true value.
| Precision | The closeness of two or more values to each other.

The value of `pi` is `3.1459265359`. Now, `3.14` is a number for representing the value of `pi`, which is not precise but accurate, based on closeness. No other number with three digits can get closer to the target.

## [Significant Figures](https://www.cuemath.com/numbers/significant-figures/)

*Significant figures* are also called *significant digits*, as they are established in the form of digits. The number of significant digits can be identified by counting all the values starting from the 1st non-zero digit located on the left. 

For example,
- `0.0012` contains two significant digits, and
- `10.007` contains five significant digits.

To measure the significant figures of a calculated measurement, there are certain rules that need to be followed and remembered. 

| Value   | SG | Rule
|---------|----|------
| `894621` | 6 | All the digits except zero are always significant.
| `10.007` | 5 | Any zeros placed in between any two non-zero digits are significant.
| `0.0012` | 2 | If zeros are placed both on the right of a decimal point and left of a non-zero digit, they are not significant.
| `80.00`  | 4 | If zeros are placed on the right of the decimal and not have a non-zero digit after that, then it is significant.
| `0.00153100` | 6 | Zeros placed on the right of the last non-zero digit after the decimal point are significant.

Zeros that are placed on the right of the last non-zero digit are significant when they come from a measurement. For example, `3560 meters` contains four significant digits. 

## [Number systems](https://www.cuemath.com/numbers/number-systems/)

There are different types of *number systems* in which the four main types are:

| Number system  | Base | Digits used
|----------------|------|-------
| Binary NS      |  2 | `0,1`
| Octal NS       |  8 | `0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7`
| Decimal NS     | 10 | `0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9`
| Hexadecimal NS | 16 | `0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9` and `A,B,C,D,E,F`

For example,
- The binary number system uses only two digits: `0` and `1`. The numbers in this system have a base of 2. Digits `0` and `1` are called *bits* and 8 bits together make a *byte*.
- The decimal number system uses ten digits: `0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8` and `9` with the base number as 10.
- The hexadecimal number system uses sixteen digits/alphabets: `0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9` and `A,B,C,D,E,F` with the base number as 16. Here, `A-F` of the hexadecimal system means the numbers `10-15` of the decimal number system respectively.
